/**
 * Represents different types of indexing method to query the collection:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * 1. FLAT - Provides 100% accuracy for recalls. However, performance might be downgraded due to huge computation effort;
 *
 * 2. IVFLAT - K-means based similarity search which is balanced between accuracy and performance;
 *
 * 3. IVF_SQ8 - Vector indexing that adopts a scalar quantization strategy that significantly reduces the size of a
 * vector (by about 3/4), thus improving the overall throughput of vector processing;
 *
 * 4. RNSG - NSG (Navigating Spreading-out Graph) is a graph-base search algorithm that a) lowers the average
 * out-degree of the graph for fast traversal; b) shortens the search path; c) reduces the index
 * size; d) lowers the indexing complexity. Extensive tests show that NSG can achieve very high
 * search performance at high precision, and needs much less memory. Compared to non-graph-based
 * algorithms, it is faster to achieve the same search precision.
 *
 * 5. IVF_SQ8_H - An enhanced index algorithm of IVF_SQ8. It supports hybrid computation on both CPU and GPU,
 * which significantly improves the search performance. To use this index type, make sure both cpu and gpu are added as
 * resources for search usage in the Milvus configuration file.
 *
 * 6. IVF_PQ - Indexing method built based on product quantization. The input vectors are split into distinct sub-vectors
 * which are then quantized separately. Vector size can be reduced to 1/8 or 1/16 of the original size.
 * If you choose this index, note that there is an inevicollection trade-off between memory and search accuracy.
 *
 * 7. HNSW - Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs
